For the first 5 files originally they didn't have the specified rule and examples in the code fragments so I had to reupload the noncompliant and fixed compliant solution for each one.
That is why there is so many changes in the commits with similar titles. 
Sorry for the confusion. 
I merged my master branch to the main branch which has all of my initial and fixed uploads. If you go to the pull request and look at the master to main one it shows all the commits I made to each of the files from their original noncompliant code to the updated fixed compliant code
