For the first 5 files originally they didn't have the specified rule and examples in the code fragments so I had to reupload the noncompliant and fixed compliant solution for each one.
That is why there is so many changes in the comits with similar titles. 
Sorry for the confusion. 
I merged my master branch to the main branch which has all of my initial and fixed uploads
